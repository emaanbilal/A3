				<strong>Insights about the data/visualization:</strong>
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The visualization is trying to show new U.S. COVID-19 cases over time using a spiral plot where the
					angle encodes day-of-year (months around the circle), with the spiral moving outward from 2020 to
					2021 and finally 2022 in a clockwise direction. The band’s width or thickness represents the 7-day
					average number of confirmed cases. </li>
				<li>There is a clear pattern of large winter surges, with the biggest swell occurring in the
					late-2021/early-2022 region (the outermost ring near January 2022 becomes dramatically thicker than
					earlier parts of the spiral). Mid-2021 shows a noticeable rise (August to October) before falling
					again, possibly associated with a new virus variant. </li>
				<li>Given the radial encoding and since the months align by angle, one can discern a seasonal pattern,
					whereby similar times of year appear to have similar surges or expanded widths, (especially winter),
					even though the exact sizes are hard to compare precisely. </li>
				<li>Such a comparison emphasizes that case counts are higher now (the outermost circle, representing
					2021 to 2022) than earlier in the pandemic, given that the outer spiral segments seem thicker than
					inner ones, which supports a “spiraling” narrative. </li>
			</ul>

				<strong>Design Critique:</strong>
			</p>

			<p>
				What stands out about this plot is its ability to communicate the cyclical, never-ending nature of the
				pandemic – a perception many of us felt, and could resonate with at the time. Encoding time as a spiral
				creates an immediate metaphor, that we’re stuck in repeating waves, and because months are placed around
				a circle, it elicits a sense of periodicity in the year-by-year evolution of case counts, encouraging
				readers to look for seasonality (eg: comparing winter to winter by looking at similar angles) and making
				effective use of screen real estate. The design is also attention-grabbing since it is unusual, unlike
				the canonical COVID-19 line graph, therefore likely to be widely discussed by a general audience, which
				matters when the goal is to support an opinion piece rather than serve as a precise policy dashboard.
				The saturated red band also leverages pre-attentive attention: your eye is pulled immediately to the
				thickest regions, making the major winter surge at the outer edge hard to miss. In that sense, the chart
				is expressive in its storytelling: it makes viewers feel the “endless cycle” and suggests escalation as
				the spiral expands outward.
			</p>
			<p>
				Where it struggles is in effectiveness and interpretability. The most important variable (cases) is
				encoded mainly as band width around a curved path, rather than through position on a common aligned
				scale, making it hard to read accurately and vulnerable to line width illusion since readers may attend
				to the shaded area rather than the intended width, and the outward spiral can give later periods more
				visual dominance (VanderPlas and Hofmann, 2015). This is corroborated by Stevens’ Power Law which
				predicts systematic misestimation when people judge size/area as opposed to metrics like length
				(Stevens, 1957). The spiral also introduces a structural distortion: equal spans of time occupy longer
				physical distance in later rings, which can bias later waves to look shallower and earlier increases to
				look steeper, complicating comparisons of slopes and wave onset across years. This phenomenon can be
				understood by Weber’s Law which suggests that smaller differences in thickness become harder to notice
				as the overall thickness grows (Weber, 1846), which can cause meaningful variation in high-case periods
				to visually compress. On top of that, the chart offers limited scaffolding for a reader, asking them to
				do more cognitive work than a conventional time-series: months aren’t all labeled, it’s unclear at a
				glance where to begin/end, and there isn’t a clear y-axis-style set of reference rings (beyond the small
				“150K cases” key) and only a few month labels, making it difficult to estimate values or make confident
				comparisons across years. A small set of changes, like complete month labeling, clearer radial reference
				rings (e.g., every 50K/100K), and a stronger visual cue for the start point, would preserve the
				expressive “spiral” metaphor while improving perceptual accuracy and lowering the effort required to
				decode the most important comparisons.

					<figcaption>
						<strong>The "Steep vs. Shallow" Geometric Bias.</strong> This figure demonstrates how the
						outward expansion of the spiral creates a false sense of scale. Although both the top and bottom
						segments represent the exact same duration of time and an identical pattern of case growth, the
						top segment (moving further outward) appears significantly shallower than the bottom. Because
						the spiral maps the same time span to a longer physical distance as it expands, the "stretching"
						of the x-axis (time) flattens the appearance of later waves, making them look less urgent than
						earlier, "steeper" surges.

					<figcaption>
						<strong>Total Area vs. Case Volume.</strong> This comparison highlights how the chart’s design
						fails to accurately represent the volume of cases. When comparing the 4-month period (Nov
						2020–Feb 2021) to the 3-month period (Aug 2021–Oct 2021), the visual surface area of the red
						bands is roughly the same, giving them a "similar impression" to the viewer. In reality, the
						first period represents a far higher total number of cases. This illustrates how the lack of a
						fixed, linear scale leads to a perceptual "illusion" where significantly different data points
						look equivalent.

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

			<figure>
				<img src="s1.png" alt="Sketch 1 — refined spiral with single-sided width and reference rings." />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Sketch 1 — Refining the Spiral (Single-Sided Width + Reference Rings).</strong> A refinement
					of the original spiral: width encoded in one direction, clearer month labels, and radial reference
					rings to improve readability.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Sketch 1 Rationale</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Motivation.</strong> Rather than abandoning the spiral immediately, I wanted to first test
				whether the original form could be salvaged through perceptual corrections. Since my critique focused on
				band width illusion, lack of scaffolding, and unclear orientation, this sketch addresses those concerns
				directly while preserving the expressive “endless cycle” metaphor.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Design decisions.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Encoded cases using line width in only one direction (instead of symmetric expansion) to reduce
					area-based misperception.</li>
				<li>Added reference rings (e.g., 100K increments) to restore some form of positional markers for scaffolding.</li>
				<li>Included clear month labeling and a January anchor to reduce cognitive overhead and provide a clear starting point.</li>
				<li>Moved the encoding slightly closer to length/position-based perception, which lecture materials
					(Munzner, Stevens’ Power Law) emphasize as more accurate than area or volume judgments.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I hoped it would communicate.</strong> That the spiral can still evoke seasonality and
				escalation, but without requiring the viewer to infer magnitude purely from thick red area. I wanted to
				retain the narrative strength of the original plot while increasing its interpretability.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What worked.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The seasonal clustering remains immediately visible.</li>
				<li>Reference rings meaningfully reduce guesswork to estimate the number of cases.</li>
				<li>The single-sided encoding mitigates some of the “inflated area” bias predicted by Stevens’ Law.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What didn’t.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Even with these changes, magnitude is still being read along a curved path rather than on a common
					aligned scale.</li>
				<li>Weber’s Law suggests that as the spiral expands outward, thickness differences in later waves are
					still harder to discriminate.</li>
				<li>It still asks viewers to think of months circularly — a mental model that is not as intuitive as a linear timeline.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I wanted to explore next.</strong> A circular design that removes width entirely and
				instead encodes magnitude through a channel that may require less perceptual effort.
			</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="s1.2.png"
					alt="Sketch 2 — concentric rings with fixed width and depth/color encoding on a 5-point scale." />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Sketch 2 — Concentric Rings with Depth/Color Encoding.</strong> Fixed-width rings where
					magnitude is encoded through depth/color intensity on a discrete 5-point scale rather than
					thickness.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Sketch 2 Rationale</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Motivation.</strong> Building on Sketch 1, I wanted to preserve periodicity but eliminate the
				width illusion entirely. Instead of thickness, I encoded case magnitude through depth (color intensity)
				on a discrete 5-point scale.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Design decisions.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Used a fixed-width spiral (2020, 2021, 2022) rather than a line spiral to remove outward geometric
					bias.</li>
				<li>Encoded magnitude using a 5-point intensity scale to provide granularity and reduce continuous
					gradient ambiguity.</li>
				<li>Clearly labeled months and years to reduce orientation effort.</li>
				<li>Leant on perceptual principles from lecture: while color is not the most precise magnitude channel,
					it supports strong pre-attentive detection, making seasonal hotspots immediately visible without
					complex tracing.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I hoped it would communicate.</strong> A clean winter-to-winter comparison: January 2022
				should visibly “glow” darker than January 2021, allowing quick seasonal comparison with less geometric
				distortion.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What worked.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Seasonality becomes extremely clear.</li>
				<li>Fixed width removes slope distortion from spiral expansion.</li>
				<li>The 5-point scale simplifies magnitude discrimination, potentially aligning better with Weber’s idea
					of just-noticeable differences.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What didn’t.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Color intensity sacrifices numerical precision compared to positional encoding.</li>
				<li>Viewers must reference the legend to decode exact magnitude.</li>
				<li>Subtle differences within the same bin disappear.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I wanted to explore next.</strong> A return to positional encoding via a line plot (a
				stronger magnitude channel) while preserving shared seasonal alignment.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="s2.png" alt="Sketch 3 — overlaid seasonal line chart with shared axes." />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Sketch 3 — Overlaid Seasonal Line Chart.</strong> Overlaid line chart with shared x- and
					y-axes to prioritize comparability.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Sketch 3 Rationale</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Motivation.</strong> This sketch intentionally abandons the circular metaphor in favor of a more
				intuitive time-series form. Since months are more naturally conceptualized linearly, this reduces
				cognitive friction and aligns with canonical COVID-19 plots.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Design decisions.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Used a shared x-axis (months) and y-axis (cases) to enable direct positional comparison.</li>
				<li>Overlaid multiple years on a common baseline to make seasonal differences immediately perceptible.
				</li>
				<li>Added annotations to guide attention to key surges.</li>
				<li>Relied on position on a common scale as the most accurate magnitude channel.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I hoped it would communicate.</strong> That winter peaks are consistently dominant and that
				2022 represents an extreme outlier, without requiring viewers to interpret curved geometry.</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What worked.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Comparisons are fast and perceptual rather than cognitive.</li>
				<li>Seasonal alignment remains visible.</li>
				<li>Magnitude estimation is significantly easier.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What didn’t.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Overlapping lines create clutter and make trajectories difficult to follow.</li>
				<li>The expressive “endless cycle” metaphor is lost.</li>
				<li>Time continuity across years becomes less narratively compelling.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I wanted to explore next.</strong> A format that preserves comparability but reduces
				overlap and filtering interference.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="s2.2.png" alt="Sketch 4 — stacked seasonal line chart with shared seasonal axis." />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Sketch 4 — Stacked Seasonal Line Chart.</strong> Stacked chart with shared seasonal axis;
					magnitude encoded redundantly via line and shading.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Sketch 4 Rationale</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Motivation.</strong> This iteration responds directly to the overlap issue in Sketch 3. By
				stacking the years vertically, each trajectory becomes easier to follow while preserving the same month
				structure.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Design decisions.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Used a faceted plot with shared axes to preserve comparability.</li>
				<li>Applied redundant encoding: both line height and shading represent magnitude, reinforcing perception
					(in line with the lecture concept of redundancy gain).</li>
				<li>Maintained consistent scaling across panels.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I hoped it would communicate.</strong> Clear individual year trajectories, while still
				enabling seasonal comparison across aligned months.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What worked.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Much easier to trace individual waves.</li>
				<li>Redundancy strengthens magnitude perception.</li>
				<li>Seasonal patterns remain aligned across panels.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What didn’t.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Continuity across years is less immediate.</li>
				<li>Requires viewers to scan between panels to compare peaks.</li>
				<li>Less visually dramatic than the spiral.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I wanted to explore next.</strong> A format that mirrors how we intuitively structure
				months — more like a calendar than a chart.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="s3.png"
					alt="Sketch 5 — calendar-inspired heatmap with line overlay showing seasonal COVID-19 cases." />
				<figcaption>
					<strong>Sketch 5 — Calendar-Inspired Heatmap with Line Overlay.</strong> Calendar-inspired layout:
					uniform monthly blocks with color intensity and line overlay to encode magnitude and preserve
					seasonality.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<h3>Sketch 5 Rationale</h3>

			<p>
				<strong>Motivation.</strong> Reflecting on the mental model issue, I considered how people naturally
				conceptualize months — as calendar units, not points on a circle. Inspired by GitHub-style heatmaps, I
				explored a grid structure (sketched imperfectly, but sufficient to convey the idea).
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Design decisions.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Used uniform monthly blocks arranged sequentially in a calendar-like grid.</li>
				<li>Encoded magnitude via darkness of each block, while a line overlay shows the trajectory of cases
					through time.</li>
				<li>Kept months aligned across years so that, for example, all Januaries share the same column for easy
					cross-year comparison.</li>
				<li>Marked the current position to maintain temporal orientation.</li>
				<li>Employed redundant encoding (color + line height) to reinforce magnitude perception.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I hoped it would communicate.</strong> A quick, intuitive seasonal read: winter blocks
				should appear darker, and cross-year comparison should feel straightforward because months occupy
				identical spatial positions.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>What worked.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Leverages a familiar schema (calendar grid) that reduces cognitive effort.</li>
				<li>Eliminates geometric distortion entirely.</li>
				<li>Supports strong seasonal comparison without overlapping marks.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What didn’t.</strong>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Exact magnitude still depends partly on color decoding, which can be hard to estimate precisely.</li>
				<li>If overdesigned, block boundaries and grid lines could compete visually with the continuity of the
					overlaid line.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				<strong>What I would explore next.</strong> Adding subtle numeric annotations (for example, peak values
				within each month or labels for extreme weeks) to balance pattern recognition with precision, and
				testing a more granular but perceptually uniform color scale (e.g., carefully chosen multi-step
				sequential palette) to better separate moderate from very high case periods without overwhelming the
				viewer.</p>
